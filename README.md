#  About Me: 
-  Economics Graduate from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studied Applied Econometrics/Machine Learning & C++
-  **Currently working on:** Building a platform to tackle food insecurity in Chicago, IL
-  **Looking to collaborate on:** Projects/Papers on Urban Agriculture technology or anything related to Machine Learning/AI
-  **A previous project of mine:** Built the MVP for a group transaction application that deeplinked exisitng peer-to-peer payment applications to a single platform. The project failed due to many intricate internal/time conflicts as it was tackled in my last year at University with very little starting knowledge. That being said, I am choosing to talk about it because it was an increible learning experience that taught me how to properly build and manage a team of engineers to design a software product. It was also a massive research period where I taught myself how to code front end applications in Swift, Flutter, as well as python for building and deploying API's on the cloud. If you'd like the check out the project, the MVP is still web deployed with flutter: https://slush-towtew.flutterflow.app/
-  Since the failure of the project, I have assumed the roll as Appliction Developer for the commerical real estate company CBRE. I also continue to pursue projects on the side related to solving real world problems with software and AI/Machine Learning technology. Everyday I learn something new.. whether thats in practice at my current job, from the internet, from traveling and meeting new people, or the plethora of books and research papers I read daily.. I am constantly expanding my perspective on life/technology and I'm excited to see where this path takes me in my career!
