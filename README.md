#  About Me: 
-  Economics Graduate from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studied Applied Econometrics/Machine Learning & C++
-  **Currently working on:** Building a platform to tackle food insecurity in Chicago, IL
-  **Looking to collaborate on:** Projects/Papers on Urban Agriculture technology or anything related to Machine Learning/AI
-  **About:** Built the MVP for a group transaction application that deeplinked exisitng peer-to-peer payment applications to a single platform. The project failed due to many intricate internal/time conflicts as it was tackled in my last year at University with very little starting knowledge. That being said, I am choosing to talk about it because it was an increible learning experience. I spent most of my senior year independently researching how to code front end applications in Swift and Flutter while also actively taking Applied Machine Learning classes and learning C++ at UIUC. After desigining the framework for the software, I modeled it in Flutter, started coding the front end in Swift, and had backend setup in python ready to be hosted on the cloud. Needless to say, the pieces to the puzzle were there but tackling the big payment processing competitive industry was a 1-2 idea which proved to be too difficult for my first project. If you'd like to see the flutter model here's the link: https://slush-towtew.flutterflow.app/
-  Since the failure of the project, I have assumed the roll as Appliction Developer for the commerical real estate company CBRE. I also continue to pursue projects on the side related to solving real world problems with software and AI/Machine Learning technology. Everyday I learn something new.. whether thats in practice at my current job, from the internet/books/papers, or from traveling and meeting new people.. I am constantly expanding my perspective on life/technology and I'm excited to see where this path takes me in my career!
